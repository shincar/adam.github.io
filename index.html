			<h4 class="info">2019/02/13</h4>
            <p>I'm now mastered <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css" target="_blank">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages
            </a> in Khan Academy. So, next step is to add a theme to style this blog with CSS. In this 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/html-css-further-learning/a/webpage-design" target="_blank">page</a>, it provided some tips and I will use it to have my blog looks more pretty.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, pick a palette from <a href="http://paletton.com/" target="_blank">Paletton</a>. It's really convenient for user to just move a dot in outter ring to a color you'd like. Then move indicator in middle circle to get a palette. 
                For example, I like green a lot. And this is <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=12G0u0kldvNboO4gQE9p-tbsUnH" target="_blank">the pallete</a> I'm going to use. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm really not a art-man. So I decide to not only use the pallete from Paletton, but also learn how to layout a website. Plus what I learned from Khan Academy, I know how to view source of a page. You could put "view-source:http://paletton.com/examples/webpage/index-white.html" in URL bar of chrome browser to know 
                how the example page named each block of a site, e.g. header, menu, content, and footer...,etc. I'm going to take a snapshot of my current site and you could compare later when I make CSS work. 
                <div><img src="images/OriginalStyle.png" width="600"></img></div>
                <p>Now, it looks better. Probably could be improved after I learn more. Stay tuned.</p>
              </p>
              
              <h3 class="ttl">My first game</h3>
              <h4 class="info">2019/01/31</h4>
              <p>Here is my first game - <a href="games/ClickGame.html" target="_blank">Click Game</a>. </p>
              <p>Actually it's not a game. It's just a prototype of game that use ProcessJS to create a board and let user to click on the grid. 
                It's a course project when I learned in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. Now I just finished the course and thought it would be a good idea to use github pages to host a website with my kid. We could learn together and I could guide him to the world of programming sometimes.
