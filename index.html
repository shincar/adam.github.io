  <h2 class="article-title">Add a theme for a blog</h2>

  <p>I'm now mastered <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages
</a> in Khan Academy. So, next step is to add a theme to style this blog with CSS. In this 
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/html-css-further-learning/a/webpage-design">page</a>, it provided some tips and I will use it to have my blog looks more pretty.

    First, pick a palette from <a href="http://paletton.com/">Paletton</a>. It's really convenient for user to just move a dot in outter ring to a color you'd like. Then move indicator in middle circle to get a palette. 
    For example, I like green a lot. And this is <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=12G0u0kldvNboO4gQE9p-tbsUnH">the pallete</a> I'm going to use. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm really not a art-man. So I decide to not only use the pallete from Paletton, but also learn how to layout a website. Plus what I learned from Khan Academy, I know how to view source of a page. You could put "view-source:http://paletton.com/examples/webpage/index-white.html" in URL bar of chrome browser to know 
    how the example page named each block of a site, e.g. header, menu, content, and footer...,etc. I'm going to take a snapshot of my current site and you could compare later when I make CSS work.

  <h2 class="article-title">My first game</h2>
  <h4 class="article-info">2019/01/31</h4>
  <div class="article-body">
  <p>Here is my first game - <a href="games/ClickGame.html">Click Game</a>. </p>
  <p>Actually it's not a game. It's just a prototype of game that use ProcessJS to create a board and let user to click on the grid. 
    It's a course project when I learned in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Khan Academy</a>. Now I just finished the course and thought it would be a good idea to use github pages to host a website with my kid. We could learn together and I could guide him to the world of programming sometimes.
