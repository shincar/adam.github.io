  <p>Here is my first game - <a href="games/ClickGame.html">Click Game</a>. </p>
  <p>Actually it's not a game. It's just a prototype of game that use ProcessJS to create a board and let user to click on the grid. It's a course project when I learned in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Khan Academy</a>. Now I just finished the course and thought it would be a good idea to use github pages to host a website with my kid. We could learn together and I could guide him to the world of programming sometimes.
